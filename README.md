Analysis of Kim and Grofman's The Political Science 400

Data from [Kim and Grofman, The Political Science 400](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/political-science-400-with-citation-counts-by-cohort-gender-and-subfield/C1EDBF7220760F01A5C4A685DB3B3F44/core-reader): "a database with the 4,089 currently tenured or tenure-track faculty, along with emeritus faculty, at US PhD-granting departments ca. 2017-2018."

I extract the data from the table in [Appendix A](https://static.cambridge.org/resource/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20190104104300674-0444:sup-mat:20190104104300674-0444:S1049096518001786sup002.pdf) on the 400 most cited faculty. The table containts names, current (2017) school of employment, PhD-granting institution, year of PhD, and citation counts.
